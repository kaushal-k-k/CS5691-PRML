\f0\fs24 \cf0 The folder test contains two emails. \'91email1.txt\'92 is an example of a non-spam email while \'91email2.txt\'92 is an example of a spam email. Your algorithm will be run from a path which has a folder named \'91test\'92 with several emails titled \'91email1.txt\'92, \'91email2.txt\'92, etc. The algorithm should automatically open each file from the folder, extract features and predict spam (+1) or non-spam (0) for each of the emails and finally output a vector of +1 and 0 where each component corresponds to prediction of each email in the folder. }
